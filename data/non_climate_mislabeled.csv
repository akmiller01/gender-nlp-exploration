Other Multisector,Regional Cooperation and the Transformation of National Sovereignty in the Global South,REGIONAL COOPERATION AND THE TRANSFORMATION OF NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH,"This project aims to explain the different levels of regional cooperation on transboundary policy challenges in the Global South. Dominant theories fail to explain the contradictory trends regarding how developing states respond to such challenges. In some policy fields, regional cooperation is weak despite strong norms and institutions promoting regional solutions, whereas in others, it is strong although no substantial norms or institutions support it. We claim that the key to explaining this puzzle lies in the understandings of national sovereignty that the involved states develop in specific policy fields. Our main proposition is that the level of cooperation on a given transboundary policy challenge depends on whether states redefine and transform their national sovereignty in a way that sees regional cooperation as enhancing rather than constraining state autonomy. Focusing on transboundary rivers and communicable diseases, the project analyzes and compares the national sovereignty understandings of states in Africa and Southeast Asia, and how they relate to ideas about regional cooperation. The innovative comparative case study design, which includes comparison across both policy fields and regions, makes robust theory building possible. The project enhances our understanding of the conditions for regional cooperation in the Global South, and questions Western-centric and Eurocentric ideas about the link between national sovereignty and regional cooperation.",2,2,0.00854982528835535,0.00709564564749599,FALSE,1489,TRUE
